Callable interface
The class here looks very similar to the class in the previous chapter where we implemented Runnable interface. It is just that Callable class takes a generic parameter. In the example we have mentioned this generic type as String.
As Runnable has a run() mthod Callable has call() method. The difference is that call() has a return type while run() does not. And the return type should be same as the generic defines while implementing Callable. In our case String.
But here the catch, in Runnable we do not have access of the thread once it is started. Meaning that we can not check the thread whether it is completed or there was an Excpetion in the execution. Here in callable we have the handle to the thread we started. By this handle we can check if the thread has completed or there was an Exception. Lets see the test code.
Advantage:
stage1:add retrun types of call method,but not for run method
Stage2:check for end execution of run method
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;


public class CallableThread implements Callable<String>{

 @Override
 public String call() throws Exception {
  System.out.println("in Callable");
  
  
  return "finished";
 }
 

}

import java.util.concurrent.FutureTask;

public class ThreadTest {

 public static void main(String args[]) {
  CallableThread callableThread = new CallableThread();
  FutureTask futureTask = new FutureTask(callableThread);
  futureTask.run();
  System.out.println("hi");
  try {
   System.out.println(futureTask.get());
  } catch (Exception e) {
  }
 }
}

Q)What is the output?
int i=1;int j=10;
do
{
if(i++ > --j){
continue;
}
}while(i<5);
System.out.println("i="+i+" and j="+j);

Ans-i=5 and j=6
